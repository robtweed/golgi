# Developing With Golgi: A Comparison With React.js

This tutorial aims to show how to develop an application using Golgi rather than React.  To that end, it is based around one of the well-known, documented React Examples: [**Thinking in React**](https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html).  In this tutorial we'll demonstrate how and why you'd build the exact same example using Golgi.

This tutorial has a number of chapters:

- [Chapter 1](./GOLGI_CF_REACT_1.md) looks at how you can use the basic features of Golgi to implement the example application's basic display-only functionality
- [Chapter 2](./GOLGI_CF_REACT_2.md) looks at the modifications needed to implement the application's interactive filtering functionality
- [Chapter 3](./GOLGI_CF_REACT_3.md) optimises the application's implementation by using Golgi's built-in *state map* functionality
- [Chapter 4](./GOLGI_CF_REACT_4.md) further optimises the application's implementation by using Golgi's built-in MutationObserver functionality
- [Chapter 5](./GOLGI_CF_REACT_5.md) shows you how to optimise the performance of the example application, in particular its initial load-time, by using Golgi's optional server-side tools

Note that you can find source copies of all the directories and files used in each chapter: see the
