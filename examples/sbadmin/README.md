# Try It Out!

## SBAdmin Demo

Run this [live example](https://robtweed.github.io/golgi/examples/sbadmin/), 
demonstrating how *Golgi* turns the [SB Admin ](https://startbootstrap.com/template/sb-admin) 
theme into an actual framework that you can quickly and
easily customise to meet your needs.  

The example uses 
[*golgi-sbadmin*](https://github.com/robtweed/golgi-sbadmin/),
a ready-made, Open Source library of Golgi Components that does all the hard work for you!

This demo also showcases the very high performance of Golgi, without the need for 
complex techniques such as server-side
rendered (SSR) HTML and hydration, but just simply by applying some straightforward optimisations
of the loading of resources and simple pre-optimisations of the WebComponents and Golgi Assemblies.
Even on a slow network, you'll see how quickly the UI loads and is ready for use.

**NOTE:** You must use a modern browser that supports WebComponents to run the example!

See the [*./examples/sbadmin*](./examples/sbadmin) folder for the actual *Golgi* source code
files that implement this live example.

The [Optimisation Techniques are described here](./SERVER-SIDE-TOOLS.md).
